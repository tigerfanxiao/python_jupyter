### MIME

Browsers use the MIME type, not the file extension, to determine how to process a URL, so it's important that web servers send the correct MIME type in the response's Content-Type header. If this is not correct configured, browsers are likely to misinterpret contents of files and sites will not work correctly, and downloaded files may be mishandled.
